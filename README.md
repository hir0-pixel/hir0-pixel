### Hi, I'm Rameel Malik

Final-year Computer Engineering student at NUST Pakistan, specializing in GPU acceleration and real-time graphics optimization.

**Current Research**

I'm working on GPU memory optimization for medical imaging applications. My work focuses on enabling real-time 3D visualization of DICOM data through:
- Dynamic VRAM allocation control using CUDA-OpenGL interop
- Adaptive texel density management for performance optimization
- Mesh and shader optimization for volumetric reconstruction

**Technical Focus**

Graphics & GPU: `CUDA` `OpenGL` `Real-time Rendering` `Shader Programming`  
Medical Imaging: `DICOM Processing` `Volume Reconstruction` `3D Visualization`  
Tools: `C++` `Python` `Unity 3D` `Blender`

**What I'm Exploring**

Making computationally expensive 3D graphics and medical visualization accessible on resource-constrained hardware. My final year project demonstrates stable rendering at 30% VRAM usage with sub-millisecond allocation overhead.

**Currently**

Completing my undergraduate thesis on GPU-accelerated medical visualization and preparing applications for Fall 2026 Master's programs in computer graphics and GPU systems.
